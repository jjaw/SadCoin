## Introduction
Without sadness there could be no joy. What is liquid sadness? In our view it represents a vast and uncountable abyss of sorrows, woes and miseries all laid out in an ironic pattern, scattered throughout the lives of individuals with few metrics to record it.


### Features:

In-built useful and flexible features, such as

#### • **ERC20 Token**

#### • **Always** able to claim 1SAD for 1$USD on Optimism (currently only support ETH, have plans to support FIAT and other cryptocurrencies).

We chose Optimism for its emotional resonance.
